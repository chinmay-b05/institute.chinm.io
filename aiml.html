        <h2>Scope & Opportunities</h2>
        <p>
            Machine Learning is one of the fastest-growing fields in the technical sector. Enormous modern Industries require the expertise of skilled Artificial Intelligence professionals to expand the scope of Artificial Intelligence into many sectors, including healthcare, transport, security, gaming, voice recognition technologies, smart systems , finance, promotional network development, customer support, prediction and analytics, search engines, product recommendations, fraud detection and many more. Artificial Intelligence has found a very special place in peopleâ€™s homes as Smart Home Assistants. Computer Engineers and Scientists are striving relentlessly to impart intelligent behaviour in the machines making them think and respond to real-time situations.
            Up-skilling is a default part of any career. In the IT industry, learning new skills has become mandatory to stay with the competition.
